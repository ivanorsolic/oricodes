The Jetson Nano and the PWM/Servo driver will replace the receiver, outputting control signals to the car. If you’re buying a kit with a steering servo, motor, and ESC, **you should actually try to** **not get a receiver**, since the RC car could be specifically designed for that receivers PWM signals, and you’ll be taking it apart anyways.
