{{% notice tip %}}
Most RC cars are scaled down versions of their real-life equivalent, so they're expressed in ratios, the most common ones being (real-life size : RC model size):
{{% /notice %}}

- 1:18
- 1:16
- 1:10
- 1:8
- there are also all sorts of scales in between those (and above/below)


**Of course, the question is: why do we care, and what's better for a self-driving RC car?**

It's pretty simple: 

- a bigger RC car equals more real estate and more power to carry all of our gadgets on top of it, without damaging the motors while struggling with all of the weight,
- but a bigger car needs a bigger race track and road size we want to drive it on
