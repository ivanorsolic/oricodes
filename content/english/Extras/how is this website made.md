I made this site using:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a static site generator that converts my markdown source files into this website.
- [Learn](https://learn.netlify.com/) - a theme for Hugo which provides this sweet design and other functions.
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) - for actually typing up all of the content you see here in markdown.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - which hosts this site (and so many others) for free!
- And [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for some theme and Hugo source files editing.

The process is pretty simple:

- For every page I'd like, I write down a markdown file in Typora.
- Then I run the Hugo executable to compile the new markdown files into web pages.
- Then I just commit my static files to my GitHub repo, which Netlify automatically deploys to my website.

Pretty sweet, huh? I think so too. And it's free! And secure!
