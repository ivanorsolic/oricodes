- **Git**
  - [Windows installer here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
  - [Linux instruction here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) (but it should come with Linux out of the box).
  - [Mac OS X installer here.](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

- **A Markdown editor**
  - [I very much recommend Typora](https://typora.io/), I'm writing this using it.
  - But you can use anything you like, even [VS Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)

- **A Hugo theme you like**
  - You can see a list of themes, along with demos [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/).
  - You can also search GitHub or the Web and find any other theme you'd like.
  - I'm going to be showing two themes: 
    - [Minimal](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/) for the test website, which I'm using at [my InfoSec/Hardware blog](https://ivanorsolic.github.io) (hosted on GitHub Pages).
    - [Learn](https://learn.netlify.com/en/), which is the theme of the website you're reading this on (hosted on Netlify).
  - If you're using GitHub Pages and Jekyll or any other combination, they all come with a bunch of themes you can choose from. Or you can create something of your own. :)

- **Hugo**
  - Hugo has [great official docs on how to do this](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing), but as always, TL;DR:
  - **Any platform:**
    - [Download the latest release](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) from GitHub ([v69.0 at the time of writing](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.69.0/hugo_extended_0.69.0_Windows-64bit.zip)).
    - Just copy the binary file to a folder where you want your websites to be.
  - Platform specific alternatives [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) (e.g. [Homebrew](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#install-hugo-with-brew), [Chocolatey](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#chocolatey-windows)).
