Now to the fun part: building the RC car. This will vary very much based on your RC Car kit. If it’s ready-to-run (RTR), you should be good out of the box. If it’s an unassembled kit, you’ve got a ton of work ahead, just follow the instructions that came with the car. If you’re like me, and got something in between, you’ll have just a bit of work before running it.

In my case, I had to assemble the wheels and mount them on the car, and that was pretty much it. Other than that, I had to calibrate my ESC as per the instructions and my car was ready to go.

I found it helpful to have a ‘bro nearby that’s willing to help you assemble and Google stuff for you since you’re lazy to read the instructions completely. YMMV based on the brother that’s available to you.

## Test drive

After assembling the car, take it for a spin. If it works, you’re ready to move on to the electronics part of the project. :)
