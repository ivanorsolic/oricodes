Letâ€™s start with a list of all of the hardware Iâ€™ll be using through this tutorial, and of course, with the money shot:

## RC Car kit

The RC Car I went with was the Tamiya TT-02, which came prebuilt and even included an receiver and a remote, [for just a bit over 100â‚¬](https://www.lindinger.at/at/fahrzeuge-und-boote/modelle/onroad-und-drift-autos/tamiya-tt-02-chassis-aufgebaut-1-10-ep-4wd-mit-2-4ghz-sender). Very lucky!

The reason I went with this is that it was just such a good deal for such a car. Itâ€™s 1:10 scaled, so Iâ€™ll have plenty of real estate for hooking all sorts of electronics on it, and itâ€™s a really good car for on road driving. Thereâ€™s plenty of mods available for it and plenty of extra parts, which I even got with it, such as extra wheel bases or additional mounting arms. After working with it for a couple months now, Iâ€™d highly recommend it.

Be sure to pay attention to the level of pre-assembly your kit comes with. There are kits that can take days to assemble if youâ€™re doing all by yourself, and there are kits that are completely pre-built out of the box (commonly denoted RTR - ready to run). If youâ€™re up for a challenge, get a Tamiya kit that isnâ€™t prebuilt. They have great instructions and itâ€™s fun to get to know your car inside out. The difficulty of assembly also varies by car, and is often denoted on the box or in the instructions.

## Charger and batteries

I got a Carson Expert Charger LiPo Compact 3A set, with a Carson 3000mAh LiPo battery, [for under 30â‚¬](https://www.lindinger.at/en/batteries/chargers-und-power-supplies/chargers-230v/carson-charger-set-lipo-compact-3a-charger-2-4s-230v-lipo-7.4volt-3000mah), which is also pretty sweet!

Iâ€™d very much recommend getting a â€˜smarterâ€™ charger, with a balancing connector so you know exactly how much your battery is charged. Youâ€™ll want to store them at around 70% of their capacity if youâ€™re not using them.

I also went ahead and got an extra [Fconegy 6000 mAh](https://www.amazon.com/Fconegy-6000mAh-Battery-hardcase-Bullet/dp/B0791ZN8Z9) LiPo battery for around 25â‚¬.

And of course, per my warning on the batteries section at the RC Car primer, I got a [LiPo alarm](https://www.conrad.de/de/p/reely-lipo-checker-geeignet-fuer-zellen-2-8-1-st-1511388.html) and a [charging bag](https://www.conrad.de/de/p/reely-lipo-safety-bag-geeignet-fuer-zellen-2-1-st-1420590.html) to avoid any unnecessary explosions, housefires or general mayhem. Itâ€™s just an extra 20â‚¬ or so, but itâ€™s very much so worth it.

## Jetson Nano

Ah, the ðŸ§ z of the project, the [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit). Itâ€™s pretty much the way to go for 100â‚¬ or so, it packs a pretty decent GPU, 4x USB 3.0 ports, a *real* gigabit ethernet port, and you can punch a bit more power into it with a jumper and a 4A@5V power source with a barrel jack cable.

### Jetson Nano: MicroSD card

Youâ€™ll be needing a microSD card to run your Jetson Nano OS, and you should try getting a faster on (at least Class 10, preferably UHS-II or faster :)). 

I got an [Sandisk Extreme 64GB A2](https://www.amazon.de/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Speicherkarte-SD-Adapter/dp/B07FCMWCVB/ref=dp_ob_title_ce), UHS-3 card for about 25â‚¬.

{{% notice tip %}}

You donâ€™t have to get a huge (in terms of storage) microSD if youâ€™re planning on using an external SSD with your Jetson. Iâ€™d say 32GB would be just enough, but the price difference isnâ€™t that big, so you can go for the 64GB version just â€˜cause.

### Jetson Nano: Noctua Fan

If youâ€™re planning to run the Jetson at fully capacity (4A barrel jack mode), which you most definitely should, itâ€™s gonna need some help stayinâ€™ cool, so you should get a fan for it. 

You can pretty much get any 5V, 4-pin PWM, 40x40mm size fan, but Iâ€™d very much recommend going for a Noctua NF-A4 fan. You can choose between the 10mm or 20mm version, just be sure to get the 5V version of the fan and not the regular 12V one. 

![Noctua](/images/hardware/noctua.jpg?height=400px)

[You can get the 20mm version for about 10-15â‚¬.](https://www.amazon.de/Noctua-NF-A4x20-5V-Premium-3-polig/dp/B072Q3CMRW/ref=sr_1_6?__mk_de_DE=Ã…MÃ…Å½Ã•Ã‘&keywords=noctua+fan&qid=1564320839&s=computers&sr=1-6)

{{% notice tip %}}

Youâ€™ll also want a couple of self-tapping M3 screws or regular M2 or M2.5 screws with nuts for mounting the fan to the heatsink. Iâ€™d recommend going with the self-tapping M3 screws, itâ€™s so much easier. Also watch out for some aluminum shavings when you mount the fan on it, you wouldnâ€™t want them getting to the circuitry below and causing mayhem.

Also, if youâ€™re going with the 20mm version, get 25mm long screws. If youâ€™re going with the 10mm version, get 15mm long screws.

### Wireless LAN and Bluetooth

There are two options on getting your Nano (and your car) wirelessly connected:

- An M.2 WiFi + BT card
- USB WiFi and BT adapters

Iâ€™d highly recommend going for the M.2 option. I got the Intel 8265 card for about 10â‚¬. 

![](/images/hardware/intel.jpg?height=250px)

{{% notice info %}}

If youâ€™re getting the M.2 variant, youâ€™ll need two antennas and an IPEX MHF4 to RP-SMA adapter cable. Pay attention to the connector types, itâ€™s easy to get a wrong one, and vendors often misuse the labels, mixing IPEX, uFL, IPAX, IPX, MHF, and AM. Sometimes theyâ€™re right, sometimes theyâ€™re not.

The Jetson Nano has a **M.2 key E** slot, just to keep in mind when getting a card. It also doesnâ€™t work with NVME SSDs, if youâ€™re wondering.

Beware of the model of the m.2 card youâ€™re getting. At the time of writing, the Jetson Nano SD Card Image natively supports **only the 8265**. Technically, you should be able to use any Intel card older than the 8265 since itâ€™s supported in the 4.9 kernel, but some people had issues running even the 7265. If youâ€™re up to it, you can build [the core14 branch](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/iwlwifi/backport-iwlwifi.git/log/?h=release/LinuxCore14) on the backports git, but if you know how to do that, you probably donâ€™t need me telling it about you.
