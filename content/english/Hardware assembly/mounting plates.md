There are many options to go for when it comes to mounting your Nano and the rest of the hardware to your RC car. 

If you’re planning on 3D printing your parts, take a look at:

- The [official DonkeyCar docs](https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/build_hardware/#step-1-print-parts) which contain a lot of 3D models for printing: [chassis and adapters](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2566276), [mounting plates](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3428003), [more mounting plates](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2774944), etc.
- [Markku.ai](https://markku.ai/)’s [Chilicorn Rail](https://markku.ai/post/chilicorn-rail/) for the Tamiya cars

If you’re planning on hacking something together by yourself, you can pretty much do anything you want. I used a special aluminium plate I got as a donation for my thesis from my mentor’s father :):
