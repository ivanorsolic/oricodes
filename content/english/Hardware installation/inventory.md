Weâ€™ll begin by preparing installing the Jetson Nano image and setting up the software neccessary to connect it to the RC Car via the PCA Servo Driver.

## Preparing the microSD

The [official Jetson Nano docs](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) are great and you can just follow them until the *Next Steps* step.

If you want a TL;DR version:

- [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-sd-card-image-r322) the Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card Image
- Format your microSD card and then flash the image on it using whatever tool youâ€™d like. 
  - You can use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher)

- Insert the microSD into the Jetson and connect your peripherals to it: monitor, keyboard, mouse and an ethernet cable.

If youâ€™re using Windows, after the flashing itâ€™ll complain you need to [format the microSD before you use it](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/2024), since it doesnâ€™t recognize the Linux filesystem you just flashed on it. Donâ€™t format it, just ignore the warning.

## First boot

The TL;DR version would be:

- Carefully read through the NVIDIA Jetson software EULA and decide if youâ€™ll accept it ðŸ™ƒ
- Select the system language, keyboard layout and time zone
- Create your user and name your Jetson
- Log in

If all went well, you should see the following screen:

Congrats, youâ€™ve set up the base OS for the Jetson. On to the fun part!
