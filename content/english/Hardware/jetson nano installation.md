Before we begin assembling our hardware together, we should first prepare our Jetson Nano by installing an OS on it and verifying everything works before it gets buried among all the other hardware on the RC.

## Preparing the microSD

First, we'll prepare the microSD by installing an OS on it for the Nano to run.

The [official Jetson Nano docs](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) are great and you can just follow them until the *Next Steps* step.

If you want a TL;DR version:

- [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-sd-card-image-r322) the Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card Image
- Format your microSD card and then flash the image on it using whatever tool youâ€™d like. 
  - You can use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher)

- Insert the microSD into the Jetson and connect your peripherals to it: monitor, keyboard, mouse and an ethernet cable.

If youâ€™re using Windows, after the flashing itâ€™ll complain you need to [format the microSD before you use it](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/2024), since it doesnâ€™t recognize the Linux filesystem you just flashed on it. Donâ€™t format it, just ignore the warning.

## First boot

The TL;DR version would be:

- Carefully read through the NVIDIA Jetson software EULA and decide if youâ€™ll accept it ðŸ™ƒ
- Select the system language, keyboard layout and time zone
- Create your user and name your Jetson
- Log in

If all went well, you should see the following screen:
