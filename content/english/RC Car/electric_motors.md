### The main question concerning electric motors is: **brushed or brushless?**

![Related image](/images/rc_car/brushed_brushless.jpg)

- **Brushed pros:** cheaper, simpler, better for off-road. 
- **Brushed cons:** heavier, bigger, worse power efficiency (75-80%), they wear out in time.

- **Brushless pros:** long lifespan, much better speed and handling, better power efficiency (85-90%).
- **Brushless cons:** much more expensive, worse for off-road.

So what should we get? It depends on your budget, but brushed motors work just fine, and besides, for self-driving purposes, you don’t need a RC car that drives 100 KPH.

It’s always possible to swap out a brushed motor for a brushless later on.
