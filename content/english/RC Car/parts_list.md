There’s a lot of, and I mean a lot of parts when it comes to building an RC car on your own. But in the context of building a self-driving RC car, here’s a brief overview of some of the stuff we’ll need:

## You'll want to have:

- **A RC car (with some batteries)**
- A PWM/Servo Driver (I2C + some jumper cables)
- A Jetson Nano
- A powerbank (+ some usb cables)
- A microSD card (and optionally an external SSD)
- A WiFi/BT m.2 card (key E) or some USB equivalent
- Some tools and materials for building the chassis (and optionally access to a 3D printer)
- An Xbox/PS/PC gamepad

Let’s focus on the RC car (and the batteries) part for now.

## What RC car should I get?

You can basically get any RC car, as long as it has an ESC controller, or you can hook up one to it.
