**An RC servo is used for controlling the steering wheels of the car.** It almost always comes with the RC car, so you shouldnâ€™t worry about getting one.

It typically expects around 4.8V to 6V input on the power wire (varies by car) and a PWM control signal on the signal wire. Typically, the three wires are colored black-red-white, or brown-red-yellow, where:

- the dark wire (black/brown) is ground, 
- and the center wire (red) is power, 
- and the light wire (white/yellow) is control.

The control signal is RC-style PWM, where one pulse is sent 60 times a second, and the width of this pulse controls how left/right the servo turns. When this pulse is:

- 1500 microseconds, the servo is centered; 
- 1000 microseconds, the servo is turned all the way left (or right)
- 2000 microseconds, the servo is turned all the way in the other direction.

**This is NOT the same kind of PWM that you would use to control the duty cycle of a motor, or the brightness of a LED.**

The power for the servo typically comes from the motor ESC, which has a BEC (Battery Eliminator Circuit) built in.
