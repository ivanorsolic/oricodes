## Hello there! My name is [Ivan](https://twitter.com/ivanorsolic), and I'm building a **self-driving RC Car** for my Master's thesis.
This website is a guide meant for everyone that would like to build a self-driving RC car model. Even if you don't have/want a physical RC, you can still follow by using the simulator we'll build! 

**I'll go through everything from building your RC car and the low level electronics stuff to hacking kernels and teaching your car how to drive** and even do stuff like change lanes using deep learning.

This is still a work in progress which gets updated regularly, but there's more than enough material for you to make an RC drive itself. :)

#### **Scroll below for a sneak peek and a couple of recommended posts!**

### I'd recommend checking out:

- [**My idea of how to teach a vehicle to drive itself**](/artificial-intelligence/integrating-the-lane-finding/#the-idea-of-teaching-a-vehicle-to-drive-autonomously): an idea similar to networks like the *"[HydraNets](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE?t=171)"* Tesla uses (but ~~probably~~ certainly dumber)
- [**Master recipe: How to learn your machines**](artificial-intelligence/how-to-train-your-model/): a basic recipe for model training, might be interesting if you're already doing ML/DL stuff
- [**Lane changing behaviour**](/artificial-intelligence/adding-behaviours/) and [**object tracking and recognition**](object-detection-and-tracking/): PoCs and demos, I'll publish the latter in a couple of days!
