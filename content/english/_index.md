### Hi there! 

#### My name is [Ivan](https://twitter.com/ivanorsolic), and I’m currently working on a self-driving RC car for my Master’s thesis. 



This website is meant to be a guide/tutorial for all those interested in making their own self-driving RC, and will be updated regularly to document my progress working on it. 

Feel free to ping me at  {{% button href="https://twitter.com/ivanorsolic" icon="fab fa-twitter" %}}Twitter{{% /button %}} or at my  {{% button href="mailto:ivanorsolic@gmail.com" icon="fas fa-envelope" %}}E-mail{{% /button %}} if you want to get in touch or know more/ask anything.
