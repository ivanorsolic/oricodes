Using reinforcement learning in the real world for cars is pretty dangerous and expensive, since they'll be crashing into everything they can at the very beginning. To counter this, we'll be creating an OpenAI environment in which the car learns to drive by itself in order to pretrain weights for real life use.

Take a look at the donkey-gym for examples if you really want to try it. Good luck.
