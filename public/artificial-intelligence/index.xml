      <description>Where do we even begin with the AI part of the project?
Well, I think it&#39;d be a good idea to get the details of plugging a custom network into Donkey out of the way first.
If you remember the first autopilot we trained for sanity checking purposes, you&#39;ll recall we&#39;ve used an architecture that came with Donkey, whose source can be found at donkeycar/parts/keras.py.
And that&#39;s pretty cool, we&#39;ve already got a fair number of architectures to play around with out of the box.</description>

      <title>Computer Vision: Lane Finding</title>

      <description>Remember we&#39;ve showed before that our CNN is taking the horizon as the input feature, and that we&#39;ll be addressing it after making a simulator mod that&#39;ll allow us to take high res images. Well, the time has come!
We&#39;ll be using some computer vision tricks to help it find the lane lines easier.
Quick overview of what we&#39;ll be doing Here&#39;s what it will look like. We&#39;ll be going through a detailed explanation and implementation further on, this is just a motivational example.</description>
