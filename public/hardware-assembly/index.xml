      <description>Let’s start with a list of all of the hardware I’ll be using through this tutorial, and of course, with the money shot:
RC Car kit The RC Car I went with was the Tamiya TT-02, which came prebuilt and even included an receiver and a remote, for just a bit over 100€. Very lucky!
The reason I went with this is that it was just such a good deal for such a car.</description>

      <description>Now to the fun part: building the RC car. This will vary very much based on your RC Car kit. If it’s ready-to-run (RTR), you should be good out of the box. If it’s an unassembled kit, you’ve got a ton of work ahead, just follow the instructions that came with the car. If you’re like me, and got something in between, you’ll have just a bit of work before running it.</description>

      <description>There are many options to go for when it comes to mounting your Nano and the rest of the hardware to your RC car.
Option 1: 3D printing If you’re planning on 3D printing your parts, take a look at:
 The official DonkeyCar docs which contain a lot of 3D models for printing: chassis and adapters, mounting plates, more mounting plates, etc. Markku.ai’s Chilicorn Rail for the Tamiya cars  I actually used the Chilicorn Rail for the first iteration of my build, and was very lucky to have been introduced by my mentor to Mitch, who printed out the parts and helped me out with a ton of stuff since then:</description>
