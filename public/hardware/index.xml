      <description>Let’s start with a list of all of the hardware I’ll be using through this tutorial, and of course, with the money shot:
RC Car kit The RC Car I went with was the Tamiya TT-02, which came prebuilt and even included an receiver and a remote, for just a bit over 100€. Very lucky!
The reason I went with this is that it was just such a good deal for such a car.</description>

      <title>Assembling the RC Car</title>

      <description>Now to the fun part: building the RC car. This will vary very much based on your RC Car kit. If it’s ready-to-run (RTR), you should be good out of the box. If it’s an unassembled kit, you’ve got a ton of work ahead, just follow the instructions that came with the car. If you’re like me, and got something in between, you’ll have just a bit of work before running it.</description>

      <title>Building the mounting plates for the hardware</title>

      <description>There are many options to go for when it comes to mounting your Nano and the rest of the hardware to your RC car.
Option 1: 3D printing If you’re planning on 3D printing your parts, take a look at:
 The official DonkeyCar docs which contain a lot of 3D models for printing: chassis and adapters, mounting plates, more mounting plates, etc. Markku.ai’s Chilicorn Rail for the Tamiya cars  I actually used the Chilicorn Rail for the first iteration of my build, and was very lucky to have been introduced by my mentor to Mitch, who printed out the parts and helped me out with a ton of stuff since then:</description>

      <title>Preparing the Jetson Nano</title>

      <description>Before we begin assembling our hardware together, we should first prepare our Jetson Nano by installing an OS on it and verifying everything works before it gets buried among all the other hardware on the RC.
Preparing the microSD First, we&#39;ll prepare the microSD by installing an OS on it for the Nano to run.
The official Jetson Nano docs are great and you can just follow them until the Next Steps step.</description>

      <description>Now we can finish up our Nano by connecting the WLAN card, microSD and the fan to it.
Plugging in the microSD I actually already did a lot of assembly some time ago, and I&#39;m writing this in retrospect, so don&#39;t be worried if my Nano has a lot of stuff already hooked up to it and if it looks a bit different than yours, just focus on the stuff we&#39;re going through and disregard the rest.</description>

      <title>Connecting the RC to the Nano</title>

      <description>Now comes the part that should differ the most, based on the RC you got. But don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s very much doable no matter the RC you got!
Finding your ESC/Servo The first thing you should do is find your ESC and your Servo connectors, which should be a three wire connector coming from your RC car.
If you&#39;ve bought a car that came with a wireless receiver, both the connectors should be connected to it.</description>
