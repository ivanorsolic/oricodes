	"content": "  The best body type for on road self-driving purposes is the standard race body type.\n But to be thorough, we could roughly group all of the RC cars in 4 distinct categories:\nRACE/STREET Probably the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of an RC car, a standard race car. This body type is the fastest and the best on paved, flat surfaces and is meant for on road use only.\n There is also a specialized group of RC cars of this body type that are meant for drifting on racing tracks. The main difference are the tires, which are much slicker than regular ones.\nBUGGY Buggies are the golden middle between an off-road and on road RC car. That being said, they can go off-road, unlike a regular racing car, so that makes them the best bet for people that aren\u0026rsquo;t sure if they want to go off-road or on road. They are the second best thing on the road but the slowest off-road.\n TRUGGY Truggies are also an in-between body type, but they lean more to the off-road role, as opposed to the buggies. Consider them a buggy with monster truck tires.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re the second fastest body type off-road, and the third fastest on road.\n TRUCKS These are your regular monster trucks. For a self-driving application, they\u0026rsquo;d be pretty bad, since they tend to flip over while making on road turns, so it\u0026rsquo;s best to stick with them only if you\u0026rsquo;re planning to go off road in the woods, grass or dirt.\nThey are the best for going off-road but the slowest for going on road.\n "

	"content": " The main question concerning electric motors is: brushed or brushless?  Brushed pros: cheaper, simpler, better for off-road. Brushed cons: heavier, bigger, worse power efficiency (75-80%), they wear out in time.\n Brushless pros: long lifespan, much better speed and handling, better power efficiency (85-90%).\n Brushless cons: much more expensive, worse for off-road.\n  So what should we get? It depends on your budget, but brushed motors work just fine, and besides, for self-driving purposes, you don’t need a RC car that drives 100 KPH. It’s always possible to swap out a brushed motor for a brushless later on.\n "

	"description": "",
	"content": "An RC servo is used for controlling the steering wheels of the car. It almost always comes with the RC car, so you shouldn’t worry about getting one.\nIt typically expects around 4.8V to 6V input on the power wire (varies by car) and a PWM control signal on the signal wire. Typically, the three wires are colored black-red-white, or brown-red-yellow, where:\n the dark wire (black/brown) is ground, and the center wire (red) is power, and the light wire (white/yellow) is control.  The control signal is RC-style PWM, where one pulse is sent 60 times a second, and the width of this pulse controls how left/right the servo turns. When this pulse is:\n 1500 microseconds, the servo is centered; 1000 microseconds, the servo is turned all the way left (or right) 2000 microseconds, the servo is turned all the way in the other direction.  This is NOT the same kind of PWM that you would use to control the duty cycle of a motor, or the brightness of a LED.\n The power for the servo typically comes from the motor ESC, which has a BEC (Battery Eliminator Circuit) built in.\nSource: DonkeyCar docs.\n"

	"content": "The role of the ESC is to take a RC PWM control signal (pulse between 1000 and 2000 microseconds) in, and use that to control the power to the motor so the motor spins with different amounts of power in forward or reverse. Many RC car kits come with an ESC preinstalled, in which case you should be just fine.\nAgain, 1500 microseconds typically means \u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo; which for the motor means \u0026ldquo;dead stop.\u0026rdquo;\nThe battery typically connects straight to the ESC using thicker wiring than the simple control signals, because the motor draws many more amps than the control. The ESC then connects on to the motor with equally thick power wiring.\nStandard motors and ESCs have a peak current of about 12A; a 1/8th scale RC car with powerful brushless motor can have a peak draw up to 200A.\nAdditionally, the ESC typically contains a linear or switching voltage converter that outputs the power needed to control the steering servo; this is typically somewhere in the 4.8V to 6V range. Most BECs built into ESCs will not deliver more than about 1A of current, so it is not typically possible to power both the steering servo and the Jetson Nano from the BEC.\nThe main thing to look out for when getting an ESC on your own is to be sure to match your motor type to your ESC type (brushed/brushless).\n  Source: DonkeyCar docs.\n "

If you’re buying a kit with a steering servo, motor, and ESC, you should actually try to not get a receiver, since the RC car could be specifically designed for that receivers PWM signals, and you’ll be taking it apart anyways.\n"

	"content": "There are two types of batteries used for RC cars: Nickel Metal Hydride batteries (NiMH) and Lithium Polymer batteries (LiPo).\nTL;DR: LiPo batteries are much better, but also more expensive.\nLithium Polymer batteries generally have higher current capacity (the amount of Amps the battery can deliver at one point while driving) as well as energy storage (the number of Amp Hours the battery stores when fully charged) so it may also last longer.\nThe amount of charge a battery can hold (how long it runs) is measured in Ampere-hours. The amount of current a battery can instantaneously deliver while driving is measured simply in Amperes.\n Amperes are often re-calculated in terms of multiples of the energy content, divided by one hour which is often called \u0026ldquo;C.\u0026rdquo; Thus, a LiPo rated for 10C and 2000 mAh, can deliver 20 Amperes of current while driving. A NiHM rated for 5C and 1100 mAh can deliver 5.5 Amperes of current while driving.\nBatteries can deliver more than the C rating for very short amounts of time, but will heat up or build up internal resistance so you shouldn’t count on that as being their standard capability.\nFor your custom car, be aware of the voltages needed for the ESC and the motor of the car, and make sure to get a battery that matches them in voltage.\nSmaller RC cars will come with NiMH for affordability, or 2S LiPo for power. Larger RC cars will use 3S (11.1V) or 4S (14.8V) or even 6S (22.2V) Lithium batteries, and thus need to have ESC and motor combinations to match.\nBe sure to get a charger that matches your battery.\n If you have a LiPo battery:\n get a good Lithium battery charger, with a balancing plug, never discharge a Lithium battery below 3.2V per cell  If you discharge a LiPo battery completely, it won’t ever be charged up to its normal voltage again, and trying to do so will overheat the battery and set it on fire.\n To prevent this, get a battery alarm and a LiPo charging bag:\n"

	"content": " Let’s start with a list of all of the hardware I’ll be using through this tutorial, and of course, with the money shot:\nRC Car kit The RC Car I went with was the Tamiya TT-02, which came prebuilt and even included an receiver and a remote, for just a bit over 100€. Very lucky!\nThe reason I went with this is that it was just such a good deal for such a car. It’s 1:10 scaled, so I’ll have plenty of real estate for hooking all sorts of electronics on it, and it’s a really good car for on road driving. There’s plenty of mods available for it and plenty of extra parts, which I even got with it, such as extra wheel bases or additional mounting arms. After working with it for a couple months now, I’d highly recommend it.\nBe sure to pay attention to the level of pre-assembly your kit comes with. There are kits that can take days to assemble if you’re doing all by yourself, and there are kits that are completely pre-built out of the box (commonly denoted RTR - ready to run). If you’re up for a challenge, get a Tamiya kit that isn’t prebuilt. They have great instructions and it’s fun to get to know your car inside out. The difficulty of assembly also varies by car, and is often denoted on the box or in the instructions.\n Charger and batteries I got a Carson Expert Charger LiPo Compact 3A set, with a Carson 3000mAh LiPo battery, for under 30€, which is also pretty sweet!\nI’d very much recommend getting a ‘smarter’ charger, with a balancing connector so you know exactly how much your battery is charged. You’ll want to store them at around 70% of their capacity if you’re not using them.\n I also went ahead and got an extra Fconegy 6000 mAh LiPo battery for around 25€.\nAnd of course, per my warning on the batteries section at the RC Car primer, I got a LiPo alarm and a charging bag to avoid any unnecessary explosions, housefires or general mayhem. It’s just an extra 20€ or so, but it’s very much so worth it.\nJetson Nano Ah, the 🧠z of the project, the Jetson Nano Developer Kit. It’s pretty much the way to go for 100€ or so, it packs a pretty decent GPU, 4x USB 3.0 ports, a real gigabit ethernet port, and you can punch a bit more power into it with a jumper and a 4A@5V power source with a barrel jack cable.\nJetson Nano: MicroSD card You’ll be needing a microSD card to run your Jetson Nano OS, and you should try getting a faster on (at least Class 10, preferably UHS-II or faster :)).\nI got an Sandisk Extreme 64GB A2, UHS-3 card for about 25€.\nYou don’t have to get a huge (in terms of storage) microSD if you’re planning on using an external SSD with your Jetson. I’d say 32GB would be just enough, but the price difference isn’t that big, so you can go for the 64GB version just ‘cause.\n Jetson Nano: Noctua Fan If you’re planning to run the Jetson at fully capacity (4A barrel jack mode), which you most definitely should, it’s gonna need some help stayin’ cool, so you should get a fan for it.\nYou can pretty much get any 5V, 4-pin PWM, 40x40mm size fan, but I’d very much recommend going for a Noctua NF-A4 fan. You can choose between the 10mm or 20mm version, just be sure to get the 5V version of the fan and not the regular 12V one.\nYou can get the 20mm version for about 10-15€.\nYou’ll also want a couple of self-tapping M3 screws or regular M2 or M2.5 screws with nuts for mounting the fan to the heatsink. I’d recommend going with the self-tapping M3 screws, it’s so much easier. Also watch out for some aluminum shavings when you mount the fan on it, you wouldn’t want them getting to the circuitry below and causing mayhem.\n Also, if you’re going with the 20mm version, get 25mm long screws. If you’re going with the 10mm version, get 15mm long screws.\n Jetson Nano: Wireless LAN and Bluetooth There are two options on getting your Nano (and your car) wirelessly connected:\n An M.2 WiFi + BT card USB WiFi and BT adapters  I’d highly recommend going for the M.2 option. I got the Intel 8265 card for about 10€.\nIf you’re getting the M.2 variant, you’ll need two antennas and an IPEX MHF4 to RP-SMA adapter cable. Pay attention to the connector types, it’s easy to get a wrong one, and vendors often misuse the labels, mixing IPEX, uFL, IPAX, IPX, MHF, and AM. Sometimes they’re right, sometimes they’re not.\n The Jetson Nano has a M.2 key E slot, just to keep in mind when getting a card. It also doesn’t work with NVME SSDs, if you’re wondering.\n Beware of the model of the m.2 card you’re getting. At the time of writing, the Jetson Nano SD Card Image natively supports only the 8265. Technically, you should be able to use any Intel card older than the 8265 since it’s supported in the 4.9 kernel, but some people had issues running even the 7265. If you’re up to it, you can build the core14 branch on the backports git, but if you know how to do that, you probably don’t need me telling it about you.\n Jetson Nano: Camera To enable the car to look around itself and navigate itself, you’ll need a camera. You can use pretty much any USB camera, or you can use a MIPI CSI camera with the Nano.\nThe cool thing about the Jetson Nano is that it’s compatible with almost all Raspberry Pi products, which includes camera.\n I went with the Raspberry Pi Camera v2, which uses the IMX219 sensor.\nI’d recommend getting an extra longer flat cable, so you don’t have to worry about the positioning of the camera relative to the Nano on the vehicle, since you only get a rather short one with the camera you buy.\n Now, about the almost all RPi products part mentioned above. If you’re buying a RPi Camera, make sure to get the newer version with the IMX219 sensor instead of the older (EOL) OV5647 sensor, since it’s not supported by the Jetson Nano image. Of course, you can build the drivers into the kernel yourself, but I’d go with the pragmatic solution on this one.\n I may also be using an Elephone EleCam Explorer Elite 4K cam I had lying around as an additional camera just for fun.\nPCA9685 Servo Driver To enable your Jetson Nano to interface with your steering servo and ESC, you’ll need a PWM/Servo Driver. I’ll be using the PCA9685 over I2C, which is pretty cheap and has lots of extra channels.\nYou might want to get some jumper cables if you don’t have any lying around, since you’ll have to connect this to the Jetson Nano’s GPIO pins somehow.\n Jetson Nano: Power bank To power all of this for a reasonable amount of time, you’ll want to get a pretty good power bank. I went with the RAVPower 20100 mAh USB-C power bank with 45W PD for about 50€.\nYou can pretty much get any power bank you’d like, but I’d recommend getting something above 10Ah and more than 2A if you plan on using the barrel jack connection on the Nano.\nJetson Nano: (Optional) External SSD First of all, why:\n With a microSD, on average you’ll get ~ 87 MB/s read speed with an access time of ~0.52 milliseconds. With a SSD, you’ll get an average read rate of ~367 MB/s and an access time of ~0.29 milliseconds.  So go ahead and get an NVMe SSD and an external USB enclosure for it. I’ll be using a LITE-ON SSD I had lying around after replacing my Razer Blade Stealth OEM one with a Samsung 970 Evo.\nGetting an external NGFF/M.2 SSD enclosure can be a very much hit-or-miss business if you’re trying to save a couple of bucks. I got lucky and got an off-brand one working at very decent speeds for some 20€. Other people I know haven’t been that lucky on their first attempt, so beware when buying it, make sure there’s an option to return it if it doesn’t work. :)\n Although this gives you about 4x more speed with your Nano, it is fairly technical and complicated and includes manually patching and building a Linux kernel, so I can only assume that you’re very very interested, since it’s so much fun. You’re here to build a nothing less than a self-driving vehicle, what’s a little kernel hacking compared to it. :)\n Jetson Nano: (Optional) Camera Lens Attachments If you’re getting the standard Raspberry Pi Camera, it won’t have much of a FOV by itself. One thing you can do, is get one of the clip-on attachment lenses for smartphones, which can greatly increase its FOV.\nI got something like this:\nThese lenses are what they are, cheap. With cheap lenses come all sorts of nasty stuff, like chromatic aberration and barrel distortion. Try to look at some of the customer reviews that contain photos and find one with a bit less distortion.\n The Rest: Tools and stuff Of course, you’ll need some basic tools, such as:\n A good scalpel A cutting board A hand drill (depending on what you’re planning to use as your base) Screwdrivers with an assortment of M3 screws (various lengths, with nuts)  But that’s pretty much it for the inventory. On to building it!\n"

If it’s an unassembled kit, you’ve got a ton of work ahead, just follow the instructions that came with the car. If you’re like me, and got something in between, you’ll have just a bit of work before running it.\nIn my case, I had to assemble the wheels and mount them on the car, and that was pretty much it. Other than that, I had to calibrate my ESC as per the instructions and my car was ready to go.\n\nI found it helpful to have a ‘bro nearby that’s willing to help you assemble and Google stuff for you since you’re lazy to read the instructions completely. YMMV based on the brother that’s available to you.\n Pics or it didn’t happen Test drive After assembling the car, take it for a spin.
